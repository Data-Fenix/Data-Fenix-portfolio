      <title>Project 1: Mobile Price Prediction</title>

      <description>In this project we are trying to predict the price of the mobile based on their features and the brand. We used a web-scraped dataset for this analysis and we applied many preprocessing techniques to preprocess this dataset. The dependent variable of this model is price and itâ€™s continuous data. Therefore we used regression techniques to get the prediction and trained linear regression, elastic net regression, extra tree regressor, random forest regression and support vector regression models respectively.</description>

      <title>Project 3: Telco Customer Churn Prediction Model</title>

      <description>A ML workflow is a sequence of ML related task that runs in a sequential manner. This workflow helps to automate the overall MLOps workflow, from data ingestion, preprocessing, training, optimizing and deployment. So in this project, we will demonstrate a simple end to end ML pipeline workflow deployment using AWS SageMaker.
  ML use case of this project is, identify the churn customers in telco company and identifying those customers&amp;rsquo; saves millions of money to the company.</description>

      <title>Project 4: Telco Customer Churn Prediction Model - Inference Pipeline </title>

      <description>Previously we developed a customer churn prediction model using classification technique and already deploy that model in the production enviornment (To see that project, please click here).
  Now our client/organization needs the prediction in each week. If the prediction is to be done in each week and if the process(full pipeline) has to be done every week, it will consume so much time, effort and resources. Therefore, we can retrain the model quarterly (may depend on the requirement of the company).</description>

      <description>What is code repository? A code repository is a place to store codes, documents, notes, scripts and other items related to your project. In other words, we can say code storage. Usually, code repositories are handled by VCS (Version Control System) softwares such as git. If you need to success your software development project, you must maintain a good code repository.
